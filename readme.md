# Group Connect

Work in progress. The concept is that an event would be detected by a spike in twitter posts sharing a hashtag that are clustered geographically. Once detected a Twitter bot would @ reply to continued posts with this hashtag inviting event attendees to bookmark that events "connect" page in which attendees share profile information for future reference and networking. A kind of "missed connections" for events.
